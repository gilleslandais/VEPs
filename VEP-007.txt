New Term: #detached-header
Action: Addition
Label: Detached Header
Description: Machine-readable metadata for #this, which in general 
will be necessary for its scientific use.  Examples include FITS 
headers distributed without their data blocks or PDS label files.

Rationale:
In some archives (e.g., NASA/PDS), so-called PDS label files are 
associated to each product/document of the archive.  In the case of 
NASA/PDS data products, the label file contains the required metadata 
for decoding the content of #this.  It can be looked as a detached 
FITS header, stored separately as a plain text file, next to a data 
file consisting in a binary stream of bytes.  Clients would use the 
content type (MIME type) (e.g.: application/x-pds4-label+xml, or 
text/x-pds3-label) to enable the processing.
