New Term: #detached-header
Action: Addition
Label: Detached Header
Description: Machine-readable metadata for #this, which in general 
will be necessary for its scientific use.  Examples include FITS 
headers distributed without their data blocks or PDS label files.

Rationale:
In some formats and archives, the metadata required to decode the 
content of #this is in a separate file. In the case of NASA/PDS 
data products, for example, the PDS label file contains the decoding 
metadata. In some archives, the FITS header may be stored separately 
as a plain text file, next to a data file consisting of a binary 
stream of bytes. Clients would use the content type (MIME type) 
(e.g.: application/x-pds4-label+xml, or text/x-pds3-label) to enable 
the processing.
