New Term: #detached-header
Action: Addition
Label: Detached Header
Description: Machine-readable metadata for #this, which in general 
will be necessary for its scientific use.  Examples include FITS 
headers distributed without their data blocks or PDS label files. 

Relationships: rdfs:subPropertyOf(documentation)
Used-in: http://voparis-tap-maser.obspm.fr/voyager_pra/epn/dl/dlmeta?ID=VG1-J-PRA-3-RDR-LOWBAND-6SEC-V1.0%3APRA_I.TAB

Rationale:
  In some formats and archives, the metadata required to decode the 
  content of #this is in a separate file. In the case of NASA/PDS 
  data products, for example, the PDS label file contains the decoding 
  metadata. In some archives, the FITS header may be stored separately 
  as a plain text file, next to a data file consisting of a binary 
  stream of bytes. Clients would use the content type (MIME type) 
  (e.g.: application/x-pds4-label+xml, or text/x-pds3-label) to enable 
  the processing.

Discussion:
  In the thread at 
  http://mail.ivoa.net/pipermail/semantics/2021-June/002806.html,
  the proposal was received favourably.  There was a proposal to perhaps
  add a wider term *#metadata, but given there already is #documentation
  which probably covers a large part of such a concept already, no
  immediate need was brought forward.
