Rationale: The term is used to specify that the link target is a small
preview suitable for displaying many such "thumbnails" at one time. The
primary use case is for a user interface to load or display these in a
table or as a popup, usually one per row but a grid of thumbnails might
be useful as well.

This is used in the CADC AdvancedSearch user interface as a popup when
users mouse over the preview links and allows the application to load
many of these at once. Example (BLAST + calibrated image query):
