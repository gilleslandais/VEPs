Term: #progenitor
Action: Modification
Label: Progenitor
Description: Pre-existing science data that were used to create this dataset

Used-in: http://archive.eso.org/datalink/links?ID=ivo://eso.org/ID?ADP.2020-06-16T18:05:22.868


Rationale: The modification involves only the term description. Previous
definition was "data resources that were used to create this dataset
(e.g. input raw data)", which was ambiguous, because it could encompass
any dataset or resource used to produce #this, including calibration
data. According to usage of terms in the workflow and provenance domain
the new Description restricts progenitor to the sole less advanced
science data used to produce #this. By "science data" we mean some
signal directly obtained from observations or simulations of targeted
parts of the sky or derived from it.  This is distinguished from
calibration(-applied) data which allows to transform science data
measurements in absolute physical units. By distinguishing progenitor
and calibration(-applied) data we allow to characterize specific roles
for datasets in the process of production of #this.

The usage example is taken from the ObsCore result
http://archive.eso.org/tap_obs/sync?REQUEST=doQuery&LANG=ADQL&MAXREC=1&QUERY=SELECT+*+FROM+ivoa.ObsCore+WHERE+obs_publisher_did+%3D+%27ivo%3A%2F%2Feso.org%2FID%3FADP.2020-06-16T18%3A05%3A22.868%27

In this case #this (the record in ObsCore) is an IFS cube. The
progenitors are KMOS observations
(https://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/paranal/instruments/kmos.html) as it
appears in DataLink response.
